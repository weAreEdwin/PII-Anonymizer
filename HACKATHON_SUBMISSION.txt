THE CHALLENGE
-------------
Organizations want to use AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot to analyze 
their documents, but these documents often contain sensitive information such as 
names, emails, phone numbers, social security numbers, and financial data.

Current options:
1. Manually redact documents - slow and error-prone
2. Avoid AI tools entirely - lose productivity benefits
3. Risk exposing sensitive data - compliance violations

We needed a solution that lets users safely leverage AI tools without exposing 
confidential information.

THE PROJECT
-----------
PII Anonymizer automatically detects and replaces sensitive information in documents 
with consistent placeholders before sharing with AI platforms.

How it works:
1. User uploads a document (PDF, Word, or text file)
2. System scans for PII using pattern matching and named entity recognition
3. Each PII instance is replaced with a typed placeholder (e.g., [PERSON_1], [EMAIL_1])
4. User copies anonymized text to any AI platform
5. When done, user can decrypt to restore original values

Key features:
- Detects names, emails, phones, SSNs, credit cards, addresses, dates, organizations
- Consistent placeholders maintain document context for AI analysis
- Original values encrypted with AES-256
- Export anonymized documents as PDF, Word, or plain text
- Full audit logging for compliance

Technologies:
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, spaCy NLP, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Security: Fernet/AES-256 encryption, bcrypt password hashing, JWT authentication
- Deployment: Docker, Docker Compose
